ScanMail2PDF

This a utility app helping to process scanned documents using ocrmypdf. It does the following

+ OCR scanning of the document, creating PDFs that are searchable
+ applying corrections to the document - e.g. remove background
+ it tries to guess meaningful file name out of the ocr scanned text. The file name consists of Year & Month
  in the form of YY MM and text string derived from a url or email address in the document.
+ process existing documents w/o changing the file name

Use cases:
+ Process single PDFs from an email (e.g. Scan To Mail from a Scanner)
+ Process multiple JPEGs from an email and create one PDF (e.g. Pictures by Mobile Phone and Share through mail)
+ Process a directory of PDF of documents (e.g. from a mounted USB Storage device
+ Process a directory structure of PDF documents (i.e. including sub directores) and preserve filenames.

For the first two use cases, the app is launched w/o parametes, the third use case requires the input directory as
parameter. The last use case requires two parameters: -r <root directory of structure>
